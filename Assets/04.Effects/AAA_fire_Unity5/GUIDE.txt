In order to use this effects just drag&drop them to your scene.
Fireballs have Random_movement script assigned to them, you can delete it
or replace it with your own code.
In order to scale an effect drag&drop it to the scene and assign a Scaler script 
to it(it can be found in the scripts folder). You need to assign the script only to the parent.
It will find children automatically. Press start(start the scene) and 
change the effect scale coefficient using slider. After you get the desired size just drag&drop 
this effect from hierarchy to your folder.

That's it.
